##FOR PMs TO DO
Content for 10-15 user profiles; 2-3 cards each

##DEV SCHEDULE

Day 1: Models - info for card, user > build basic templates

Day 2: Preview cards and get them linked

Day 3: Get things onto bulletin board

Day 4: Build shell of site

Day 5: Filtering, sorting, pop-up windows

Day 6 & 7: Malcolm - design

##Risk
Sorting part at end - Angular
Fallback - default alphabetical order; search bar
Is there a way to build something simple at first?  Probably not.  Have it render on page using Rails.

##MVP concept note

We (Miranda, Sebastian, Patty, Malcolm, Danny and Joe) agree to work collaboratively to create GA Extend, a user-driven online community for General Assembly program alumni.  GA Extend features an online bulletin board listing opportunities in the Skill Share, Projects and Networking categories designed to facilitate postgraduate connections.  We are targeting GA alumni currently on the job market and promoting productive engagement through user interaction on our site, as skill acquisition, continuing education and collaborative work will increase marketability for alumni seeking jobs in the industry.
